# Rüümli Dashboard

This app will be a Dashboard for a Studio that a few of my friends have.

## Intented main features
- Control the home assistant
- Display the stats of the dart tournaments that happen in the studio
- Display a shared pictures folder and a QR code that leads to said folder

## Nice-to-haves
- Overview of all planned Events at the studio
- Some kind of plant health overview to keep track when they were last watered
- Some kind of white board guest list

The goal is to hang a tablet next to the door so everyone that enters can use the app and has a overview about everything
